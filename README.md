In the instructions I describe the construction of the toy "Ursus 385 Tractor", which I made for my grandson. This project and others made by me, together with SVG files, are available at https://github.com/ZET-System/ZET-Toy-Tractor. I have placed the instructional video at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpifb5z4qqLqFVbfuf9Qllg.
Other projects that I have already made (tractor trailer, remote-controlled fire ladder, remote-controlled crane and many others) will be placed in the same place on GitHub.

I will be happy to help people who have doubts about how to build this or another toy. Please send questions to the email address zbigniew.wlodarczyk@hotmail.com.
