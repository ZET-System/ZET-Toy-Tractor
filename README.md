In the manual, I describe the construction of the toy 'Ursus 385 Tractor', which I made for my grandson. This project, along with other projects and SVG files, is available at https://github.com/ZET-System/ZET-Toy-Tractor.
I have placed the instructional video at https://www.youtube.com/zetsystem.
Other projects that I have made, like the tractor trailer, remote-controlled fire ladder, and remote-controlled crane, will be placed in the same location on GitHub.
I will be happy to help people who have questions about how to build this toy or another toy. Please send your questions to the email address zbigniew.wlodarczyk@zetsystem.com.pl
